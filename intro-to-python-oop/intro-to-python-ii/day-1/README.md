# Intro to Python II - Day 1

## Classes

- PascalCase for class names, snake_case for method/property names.
- start with the constructor `def __init__(self)`
- Always use `self` keyword as the first argument for class methods.
- Always use `self.[property/method]` to refer to class properties/methods.
